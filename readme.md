#  Formula 1 True/False Quiz in Python üèéÔ∏è

As someone who just recently got into the world of Formula 1, I decided to combine my interest in F1 with my journey in learning Python.

This project is a **terminal-based True/False quiz** about Formula 1 ‚Äî covering drivers, teams, race history, and general F1 knowledge. It's built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python and is a great exercise for beginners learning about classes, functions, and modular programming.

## üéØ Features

- ‚úÖ 30 curated True/False questions about Formula 1
- ‚úÖ Tracks score and gives instant feedback
- ‚úÖ Uses OOP: `Question`, `QuizBrain`, and a main loop
- ‚úÖ Includes a custom ASCII intro for F1 vibes

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The project has the following modules:

- **`main.py`** ‚Äî Main loop, game flow control
- **`data.py`** ‚Äî Contains F1 questions and show_f1_intro function
- **`question_model.py`** ‚Äî Defines the `Question` class
